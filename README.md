Supplementary material for the chapter "Vector Autoregressive Moving Average Models" in Vol 41 of Handbook of Statistics

* `tools.R` contains the R code for some utility functions.
* `prCoin_Quarterly.txt` is a data set used for the demonstration examples. The data set contains three quarterly time series series from the ”FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)” database (https://fred.stlouisfed.org): Real Disposable Personal Income, Real Gross Private Domestic Investment and PCECC96 Real Personal Consumption Expenditures. See also the file `prCoin_REDME.txt` for more details.
* `Rdemonstration.Rmd` contains all the demonstration examples of the paper (`Rdemonstartion.pdf`, `Rdemonstration.tex` are the outputs). This file also provides a cursory overview of time series modeling with VARMA models and state space models and some documentation for the utility functions in `tools.R`.
